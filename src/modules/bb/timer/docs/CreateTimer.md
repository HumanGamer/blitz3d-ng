# CreateTimer (hertz)

## Parameters

- hertz = a frequency, usually a framerate like 50 or 60

## Description

Use this command in conjunction with the WaitTimer command to control the  speed of program execution (fps). You will use this in your main screen redraw  loop to control the playback speed to match the proper speed. This will prevent  your games from playing back too fast on computers faster than yours. Use of  this system is VERY GOOD practice, as your game will be played on a variety  of computers.
