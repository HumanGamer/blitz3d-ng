# Floor# ( n# )

## Parameters

- n = any number

## Description

Rounds downward, i.e. in the direction of -Infinity.
It is a common mistake to think this simply sets everything after the decimal point to zero.But this is true only for positive numbers:
Floor(  1.75 ) ....... 1.0
Floor( -1.75 ) .... -2.0
See also Ceil and Int for other types of rounding.
