# ChannelPlaying (channel)

## Parameters

- channel = variable assigned to the channel when played

## Description

Often you will need to know if a sound channel has completed playing or  not. This command will return 1 if the sound is still playing or 0 if it has  stopped. Use this to restart your background music or some other sound that  might have stopped unintentionally.Note: This command currently doesn't seem to work with a channel assigned to  CD track playback.
