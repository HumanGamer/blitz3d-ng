# MilliSecs()

## Description

This command will return to you the system timer value in milliseconds.
This is incredibly useful for precision timing of events. By reading this value  into a variable, and checking it against the CURRENT time in milliseconds, you  can perform 'waits' or check time lapses with a high degree of accuracy. A common  use of this command is to seed the random number generator with the SeedRnd command.
