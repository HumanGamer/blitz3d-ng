# SoundPitch sound, hertz

## Parameters

- sound = any valid sound variable previously created with the LoadSound  command.- pitch = valid playback hertz speed (up to 44000 hertz).

## Description

Alters the pitch of a sound previously loaded with the LoadSound command. By changing the pitch, you can  often reuse sounds for different uses or to simulate a 'counting up/down' sound.  To make the sound 'higher pitched', increase the hertz. Conversely, decreasing the hertz will 'lower' the pitch. Note: this is in relation to the original hertz frequency of the sound.
