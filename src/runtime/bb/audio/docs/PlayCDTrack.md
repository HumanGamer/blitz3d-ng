# PlayCDTrack( track,[mode] )

## Parameters

- track = track number to play
- mode = 1; play track once, 2; loop track, 3; play track to end of CD

## Description

Plays a CD track and returns a sound channel.
The optional mode parameter allows variations of playback. Remember, the playback happens through the CD cable inside the computer that attaches to the sound card. Many  computers (for some reason), don't have this cable inside properly attached. If this is the case, you will NOT hear CD sound even though you hear other sound  effects and music.
